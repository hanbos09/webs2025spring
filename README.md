# Project 3: Website Portfolio

For this project, I want to create a digital scrapbook, mainly for myself, but also for other people. I want to include a lot of pictures from my travels with captions and location markers.

Okayyy figured it out. To find the website, go into the folder: CDMweb
That should have everything in it.
I still need to add my images to it and I know the css is looking rough but its getting there!
