# Project 3: Website Portfolio
For this project, I created a digital scrapbook with a few pictures from my travels. While it is not fully completed, I intend to continue to add more pictures under the locations and add a bit more css when I learn more of it.

All other pictures have been taken on my phone or a handheld camera owned by myself, Hannah Bosco.


Reflection:
For my website, I wanted to create a digital scrapbook for mainly myself with pictures of my travels. I knew I wanted it to be like a directory almost, where it looks kind of like a book with each location being like a chapter and the travel and local sections being like parts 1 and 2.

Creative Process:
It took a while for me to get used to writing html and css. I definitely outsourced some help from both tutorials, google, and youtube, but I got the hang of it.
With my html I wasn't planning on shooting for the stars, but instead just taking what I could control and understand, and making something serviceable.
For my css, I went with a simple pretty-in-pink style with soft edges and cutesy fonts to fit my aesthetic and make it pleasing to the eye. I also found out how to make the pictures round and slightly enlarge when hovered over.
The coding really was trusting the process and I ran into a lot of issues along the way that, while they had simple fixes, definitely discouraged me and got in my way. I ended up turning to Freeformatter.com -https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html to help check my html and see where I went wrong. It helped me realize that is was almost always a location issue and not an issue with the actual html writing.
The css was easier because I was able to just keep adding on and adjusting. Once I had a baseline with the color and rough layouts, I was able to keep adding little by little like box shadows and adding the photo gallery options.

Peer Review:
One of my peers recommended adding the hover feature, which I took and ran with. I found that the suggestions with css were the most helpful in stylizing my website.
Another one of my peers suggested having a picture for each travel site on the first page of my website, and I decided that I would use that as my aspirational criteria to add afterward.

What I Learned:
Throughout this project, I struggled with time management. I think that especially with learning something so new that I got cold feet when it came to writing and figuring out my html and css. However, I am really proud of what I made even if it is simple. I got it to a point that I am very happy with and know that I can and will continue to add to it beyond this class. Going through my classmates' portfolios also has inspired me by showing me all the options and different ideas that I could use this new knowledge for.
